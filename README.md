# Trailing Bot

*Currently the bot does not place real orders, it is just for testing*

This is a test project. I am just testing my code.

## Warnings 

So use it at your own risk! I have no responsibility for any loss or hardship incurred directly or indirectly by using this code. Read disclaimer before using this code. I cannot guarantee whether you can make money or not.

## How does it work?

This bot will look at the the lowest point of a candle. **TEKST**

Place orders at a fixed value or percentage when the price changes. Using this feature you can buy at the lowest possible price when buying down and sell at the highest possible price when selling up.

## Riskmanagement

We have two values: **BTSL** (Buy Trailing Stop Loss) and **STSL** (Sell Trailing Stop Loss).
The higher you set the value of BTSL, the longer it waits to buy.
The lower you set the value of STSL, the earlier it will sell.

## When is a trade seen a profitable?

- When bought is below sold
- When sold is above bought

*The first trade is marked as not profitable, because there is no data to evaluate if trade was profitable.*

## Backtesting

I have tested this bot with different coins, intervals, start/end dates, BTSL, STSL. 
The best values found for BTSL is **?** and for STSL is **?**.
